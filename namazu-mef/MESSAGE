*WARNING*:

1. Index file format has changed since namazu 2.0.
   If you upgrade from namazu 1.X, you need to rebuild index
   files at least.

2. In order to processing Japanese, you need to set "LANG",
   "LC_ALL", "LC_MESSAGES" or "LANGUAGE" environment to "ja".
   Because of lack of locale support, you could only use
   "LANGUAGE" environment.  This restriction is hoped to
   remove feature NetBSD release.
